<!-- Explanation
HTML Structure
	•	The HTML creates a simple layout with a title, a grid for the game board, a message area to display the current player’s turn or the winner’s announcement, and a button to start the game.
CSS Styling
	•	The CSS styles the game board as a grid and gives visual feedback for hits and misses.
JavaScript Logic
	•	Game Initialization:
	•	The game starts when the “Start Game” button is clicked.
	•	Both players’ grids are initialized and ships are placed randomly.
	•	Ship Placement:
	•	Ships are placed randomly on each player’s grid without overlapping.
	•	Gameplay:
	•	Each bot takes turns automatically.
	•	A random cell is selected for each attack.
	•	Hits and misses are visually represented on the grid.
	•	The game checks for a win condition after each turn.
